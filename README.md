This project is done as part of thesis work for the course DVGA25 at Karlstad University. The project solves a regression problem using Machine Learning and concludes 4 Python files as a result, of which 2 of them are used for data cleaning, 1 for training the ML model, and the last one for loading the model into an API. The thesis was done in cooperation with a local company called Stamford in Karlstad, Sweden, and due to privacy policy the data used to train the ML models has not been included in this repository. 
The thesis itself is found at:
